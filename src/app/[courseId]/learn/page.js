        Imagine you are working as a software tester in a company. The company created a

        Your task is to test the compiler to ensure that the compiler translates the code 
        from Krokodyle language to machine language accurately. However, since you cannot 
        read machine language, you cannot simply compare the output of the compiler with 
        the source code. This means that a <mark>test oracle might be difficult to find or

      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        To create a MR, you want to think of the properties of a sine function first. For

        The k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) and Naive Bayes algorithms are two of the most 
        famous machine learning frameworks. Xie et al. <a href="#ref15">[15]</a> performed a study where 
        they used MT to test a machine learning classifier software. They found 
        violations of MRs on the software‚Äôs implementation of these two
        algorithms. 
        <br /><br />
        After further investigation, they found out that <mark>some of the MRs that were 
        violated</mark> were <mark>not essential properties of the algorithms</mark>, instead these <mark>MRs 
        were developed based on user expectations</mark>.

        Zhang et al. <a href="#ref18">[18]</a> performed a study involving the development a Steer-by-Wire (SBW) system to control the steer of a dummy vehicle. They tested the system using MT and unit tests.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        During the testing process, they <mark>found a fault through a MR violation</mark> in
        the system that was a case of ME. The MR that was violated is defined as follows:
      </p>
      <p className="indent">
        <span className="math">MR<sub>AngleConsistency</sub></span>: Rotate the steering wheel by a certain degree in one 
        direction in the source input, and by the same degree in the 
        opposite direction in the follow-up input. The absolute value 
        of the steering angle reported by the system should be the same 
        for both inputs.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        The purpose of this MR was to verify whether the system can generate 
        consistent outputs when the steering wheel is rotated in opposite directions. 
        The MR was violated during the test. The inconsistency was <mark>initially 
        considered as a bug in the system</mark>. After further inspection, it was revealed 
        that the <mark>test case itself was flawed</mark>. Originally, the test code required an 
        exact match of the opposite steering angle values to pass the test. However, 
        the test <mark>did not take into consideration of deviations due to the physical 
        limitations</mark> of the steering wheel. In other words, it will be difficult to 
        precisely steer at the exact angle in opposite directions. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        To address this issue, the test code was modified such that angle deviations 
        of a certain threshold will be allowed. This allowed for small deviations 
        due to hardware limitations.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This issue of <mark>expecting to match values</mark> is a <mark>common mistake

        In 2020, cyber-attacks have cost the world economy almost $1 trillion, 
        increasing over 50% in just four years <a href="#ref21">[21]</a>. Cyber crimes have greatly 
        affected businesses, leading to privacy violations, business disruption and 
        financial losses <a href="#ref22">[22]</a>. Part of this was caused by the <mark>lack of secure 
        methods</mark> in <mark>storing and retrieving user passwords</mark> <a href="#ref23">[23]</a>.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p className={styles.paragraphContent}>
        A <strong>password</strong> is usually passed into a cryptographic hash function, 
        which <mark>returns a transformed text</mark> called <strong>hashed password</strong>. Hashed 
        passwords is a <mark>string consisting of random numbers and alphabet letters</mark>, and <mark>cannot be deciphered</mark>, 
        making them <mark>impossible to crack</mark>. They are <mark>stored in the database with the corresponding user 
        account information</mark>, without including the original password for 
        increased protection. During user authentication, when a user enters 
        their password, the <mark>entered password is then hashed and compared</mark> with 
        the stored hashed password in the database <mark>to verify</mark> the user. 
        These hash functions are also <mark>irreversible</mark>, making it almost impossible

      </p>
      <br />

      <p className={styles.paragraphContent}>
        However, as computing power continues to grow, automated password-guessing 
        is becoming easier. Hence, a way for companies to ensure the security of 
        their authentication system is to hire <strong>penetration testers (pentesters)</strong>, also known as <strong>ethical hackers</strong>,
        to <mark>attempt to access the user accounts externally</mark>, which involves a method 
        called <strong>password cracking</strong> <a href="#ref25">[25]</a>. To perform this, they use password crackers, 
        which turns these hashed passwords into their equivalent password 
        through <mark>guessing</mark> [25]. However, despite password crackers being a powerful tool, 
        it remains <mark>very difficult to verify the correctness of the output of the crackers</mark>. 
        The <mark>irreversible nature of hash functions</mark> caused the <mark>oracle problem</mark> to occur 
        in password crackers, hence making MT a suitable framework for testing password 
        crackers.  Hence, this section will cover how MT can be applied on testing 
        password crackers.

        Some of the most popular password cracking attack types are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Brute-force attack</strong>: A <mark>trial-and-error method</mark> that uses <mark>every possible character combination</mark> to guess 
          and attempt to crack a hashed password <a href="#ref28">[28]</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dictionary attack</strong>: A cracking method that involves the 
          usage of <strong>wordlists</strong> (list of possible passwords), which is also known as 
          a <strong>dictionary</strong>, <mark> to try each password in the dictionary</mark> and 
          see if it is the user‚Äôs password <a href="#ref29">[29]</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rainbow table attack</strong>: An attack that <mark>compares</mark> the 
          hashed password <mark>with each entry in a rainbow table</mark>. A <strong>rainbow table</strong> is
          a large table consisting of <mark>pre-computed hash values</mark> and <mark>their corresponding passwords</mark> <a href="#ref30">[30]</a>

          <strong>John the Ripper (JtR)</strong> <a href="#ref31">[31]</a> is a <mark>free software</mark> <a href="#ref32">[32]</a>, dominating on the open 
          source password cracker market <a href="#ref33">[33]</a>. Its key features include <mark>four distinct 
          cracking methods</mark> in a single package, <mark>automatic hash type detection</mark> during 
          the cracking process, ability to <mark>crack different hash types in a file</mark>, and a <mark>customisable cracker option</mark>. It supports cracking 
          in <mark>multiple hash formats</mark>. It also has a commercial counterpart, <strong>John the 
          Ripper Pro</strong>, which is mainly distributed in ‚Äúnative‚Äù package formats for the 
          target operating system (OS) <a href="#ref30">[30]</a>. Its benefits include a simple installation

          called <strong>John the Ripper Jumbo</strong>, which supports hundreds of hash types <a href="#ref30">[30]</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hashcat</strong> <a href="#ref34">[34]</a> is another password cracking and recovery tool, 
          which refers to itself as the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs fastest CPU-based password recovery 
          tool.‚Äù It was released in 2009 as proprietary software, but was (re-)released 
          as <mark>open source software</mark> in 2015. Its enhanced equivalent, <strong>oclHashcat</strong>, utilises 
          the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), allowing significantly faster cracking 
          compared to Hashcat‚Äôs <mark>multi-threaded, CPU-based framework</mark>. Unlike JtR, Hashcat 
          also <mark>supports the MD4, MD5, and SHA-family hash types</mark>, on top of the other formats

      <p className={styles.paragraphContent}>
        One important factor to remember is that <mark>MR violations sometimes are not easily 
        identifiable</mark>. Hence, performing MT might require the tester to <mark>run numerous 
        test cases</mark> until a MR violation is identified. Performing MT manually may 
        require the tester a significant amount of time and effort, thus it may be a 
        better idea to <mark>run the tests automatically</mark>. Doing so requires knowledge on 
        a <mark>scripting language</mark> that is supported by your OS. For example on Unix-based OS, 
        such as MacOS and Linux OS, <strong>Bash</strong> will be a great option. For Windows OS, a 
        recommended scripting language is <strong>PowerShell</strong>. 
        <br /><br />
        These scripting languages can be used to produce scripts 
        that <mark>generate the hashed passwords</mark>, <mark>create a dictionary file</mark>, <mark>hash the passwords</mark>, <mark>crack 
        the hash files</mark> and <mark>output the results in a text file</mark>. 
        However, a drawback to using scripts is that the tester needs to have 
        prior knowledge on the script commands.
